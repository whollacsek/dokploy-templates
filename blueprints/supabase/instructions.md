# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Deploy

1. In Dokploy, create the service from the **Supabase** template (requires Dokploy `>= 0.22.5`).
2. Dokploy automatically generates all secrets for you (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`, etc.). You can review them in the **Environment** tab of the service.
3. Deploy and wait for all containers to become healthy. The first deploy can take several minutes while the Postgres database initializes.

## Log in to Supabase Studio

The main domain of the template points to the `api-gw` API gateway — Envoy, on port `8000` — which protects Supabase Studio with basic authentication:

- **Username**: the value of `DASHBOARD_USERNAME` (default: `supabase`)
- **Password**: the value of `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`

Both values are in the **Environment** tab of the service in Dokploy. Envoy computes
the basic-auth credential at startup, as a SHA1 hash of `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` encoded in
base64, so the password itself still comes from the Environment tab and nothing else
needs to change when you edit it.

## API URL and keys

To connect an application (for example with `supabase-js`):

- **API URL**: `https://<your-domain>` (requests are routed through Envoy)
- **anon key**: the value of `ANON_KEY` in the Environment tab
- **service_role key**: the value of `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the Environment tab (server-side only, never expose it to browsers)

### New API keys (`sb_publishable_…` / `sb_secret_…`)

Dokploy also generates the newer opaque API keys, so you can use either style:

- **publishable key**: the value of `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (browser-safe, replaces the anon key)
- **secret key**: the value of `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (server-side only, replaces the service_role key)

Envoy exchanges these for the matching JWT before the request reaches Supabase, so
clients never hold a decodable token. Its `docker-entrypoint.sh` substitutes the six key
values into `lds.yaml` when the container starts, and the listener does the translation
on every request. Both styles stay valid at the same time — existing apps on `ANON_KEY` /
`SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` keep working.

## ⚠️ If your domain has no TLS certificate, change the scheme to `http`

The template generates `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, `API_EXTERNAL_URL` and
`ADDITIONAL_REDIRECT_URLS` with an **`https://`** scheme, because that is right for the
usual case — a public domain with a Let's Encrypt certificate.

**Dokploy creates the template's domain with no certificate.** Until you enable one, the
domain answers on `http` only, and those three values point at a scheme that does not
respond. The stack comes up healthy and the gateway answers, so nothing looks broken — but:

- Studio's browser-side calls go to `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL` and fail.
- Envoy compares the request `Origin` against `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, so **CORS refuses every
  cross-origin call**, including `/pg/`.
- GoTrue signs tokens with `API_EXTERNAL_URL` as the issuer and builds OAuth redirects and
  email links from it, so all of them point at the dead scheme.

Two ways out:

1. **Enable a certificate** — Domains → your domain → Certificate → Let's Encrypt. This needs
   the domain to be **reachable from the public internet**. It will not work for a private
   address: an `sslip.io` name pointing at a Tailscale `100.x.y.z` or a LAN `192.168.x.y`
   cannot be validated, because Let's Encrypt cannot connect to it.
2. **Switch the three values to `http://`** in the Environment tab, then redeploy. This is the
   right choice for a private or tailnet-only instance.

```
SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL=http://<your-domain>
API_EXTERNAL_URL=http://<your-domain>/auth/v1
ADDITIONAL_REDIRECT_URLS=http://<your-domain>/*,http://localhost:3000/*
```

Keep `API_EXTERNAL_URL` ending in `/auth/v1`. Without that path GoTrue advertises
`<domain>/callback` as its OAuth `redirect_uri`, and the gateway routes a bare `/callback` to
Studio rather than to auth, so every social sign-in dead-ends on the dashboard login prompt.

## Upgrading an existing Supabase service (Kong → Envoy)

⚠️ **Only if you already run this template on its Kong version.** A fresh install can skip this.

The API gateway service is renamed `kong` → `api-gw`. Dokploy checks the domain's service
name against the compose file, so a redeploy fails with
`Domain ... is attached to service "kong" which does not exist in the compose` until you
fix the domain first.

1. Open **Domains**, edit the domain, change **Service Name** from `kong` to `api-gw`.
   Leave the port at `8000`.
2. Deploy. The stale `kong` container is removed automatically (`--remove-orphans`).

No data is lost by the rename — the database lives in a separate volume.

## Backing up the database

The Postgres data directory is a **bind mount** (`files/volumes/db/data`), not a named
Docker volume. Two consequences:

- **Dokploy's Volume Backups cannot see it.** The panel will only offer the `db-config` and
  `deno-cache` volumes, neither of which holds your data.
- **Deleting the service deletes the database**, whether or not you tick *delete volumes* —
  the data sits inside the application directory that Dokploy removes.
- **Redeploy with fresh volumes does NOT reset the database.** It clears `db-config` and
  `deno-cache` only. A true reset means deleting the service.

Back up with `pg_dump` through the pooler, or copy
`/etc/dokploy/compose/<appName>/files/volumes/db/data` off the host.

## Optional: sign tokens with an ES256 key pair

Everything is signed with the symmetric `JWT_SECRET` (HS256) by default. Moving
to an asymmetric key pair needs an EC P-256 key, which Dokploy's variable
helpers cannot generate, so `JWT_KEYS` and `JWT_JWKS` ship empty. To switch:

1. Fetch Supabase's key generator. Only this one script is needed — cloning the
   whole repository pulls a very large monorepo for a 7 KB file. It needs `node`
   (>= 16), or Docker as a fallback:

   ```bash
   mkdir supabase-keys && cd supabase-keys
   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/docker/utils/add-new-auth-keys.sh
   ```

2. Put **this deployment's** `JWT_SECRET` (from the Environment tab) into a local `.env`:

   ```bash
   echo "JWT_SECRET=<your-JWT_SECRET>" > .env
   ```

3. Generate the keys. `--update-env` is required: without it the script prints
   only four of the six values, and writes `ANON_KEY_ASYMMETRIC` and
   `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_ASYMMETRIC` to `.env` alone.

   ```bash
   sh add-new-auth-keys.sh --update-env
   ```

   It exits with status **1** after writing the keys, because it then looks for a
   `docker-compose.yml` to patch and there is none in this directory. That is
   expected here — this blueprint already wires `GOTRUE_JWT_KEYS`,
   `API_JWT_JWKS`, `JWT_JWKS` and `SUPABASE_JWKS`. Check `.env` for the six
   values rather than the exit code.

4. Copy all six values from `.env` into the Environment tab, then redeploy:
   `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `ANON_KEY_ASYMMETRIC`,
   `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_ASYMMETRIC`, `JWT_KEYS`, `JWT_JWKS`.

Set them **all together**. `JWT_KEYS` makes Auth sign tokens with ES256, while
`JWT_JWKS` is what PostgREST, Realtime, Storage and Edge Functions use to verify
them — filling in one without the other makes every authenticated request fail.

## Recommended configuration

Review these variables in the **Environment** tab before using Supabase in production:

- `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL` and `API_EXTERNAL_URL`: must point to your Supabase domain with the correct `http`/`https` scheme (the template sets them from your domain automatically).
- `SITE_URL` and `ADDITIONAL_REDIRECT_URLS`: must point to the application that uses Supabase for authentication.
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SMTP_SENDER_NAME`: required for auth emails (sign-up confirmations, password resets). The template ships with placeholder values, so no real emails are sent until you configure a real SMTP provider.

**Enable `pg_graphql` if you use the GraphQL endpoint.** `/graphql/v1` is routed by
the gateway, but the extension is not installed on a fresh database, so the endpoint
answers `pg_graphql extension is not enabled`. Supabase's hosted platform ships it
enabled, so code that works there needs one statement here — run it once from
Studio's SQL editor:

```sql
create extension if not exists pg_graphql with schema graphql;
```

## Warning: changing POSTGRES_PASSWORD after the first deploy

The Postgres data directory (mounted at `files/volumes/db/data`) is initialized **once**, on the first deploy, using the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` at that moment. The same password is also assigned to the internal Supabase roles (`authenticator`, `pgbouncer`, `supabase_auth_admin`, `supabase_functions_admin`, `supabase_storage_admin`) by an init script that only runs on first boot.

If you later change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the Environment tab and redeploy, the password stored **inside the database does not change**. The other services will start using the new password while the database still expects the old one, and you will see errors such as `invalid_password` or `password authentication failed`.

To actually change the password, use one of these options:

### Option A: change it inside the database (keeps your data)

1. Open a terminal into the `db` container (in Dokploy: your Supabase service, `db` container, **Terminal**) and run `psql -U postgres`.
2. Execute the following, using your new password:

```sql
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
ALTER USER supabase_admin WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
ALTER USER authenticator WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
ALTER USER pgbouncer WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
ALTER USER supabase_auth_admin WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
ALTER USER supabase_functions_admin WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
ALTER USER supabase_storage_admin WITH PASSWORD 'your-new-password';
```

3. Update `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the Environment tab to the same value and redeploy.

### Option B: reinitialize the database (deletes ALL data)

Only if the instance has no data you care about: stop the service, delete the `files/volumes/db/data` directory of the service, set the new `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and deploy again. The database will be initialized from scratch with the new password.
